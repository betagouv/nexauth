# Alternatives

**nexauth** is very opinionated for the sake of simplifying authentication covering SSR-generated, SPAs and
API-based split applications. It's not intented to compete with more largely used authentication libraries as:

- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)
- [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/)
- [auth0](https://auth0.com/)
- [iron-session](https://github.com/vvo/iron-session)

Don't hesitate to use these libraries instead of **nexauth** if they're a better fit for your use-case.
